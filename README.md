# Rtf2Html

## Overview

This is RTF to HTML converter version 1.0
This project was created due to the lack of a similar converter for use in Delphi.
The best use is to export the content directly from TRichEdit, as it formats RTF well enough to clean it from various garbage created by other editors like Word.

## Supported features

This version supports the following:

- Character formatting (bold, italics, color, ...).
- Font faces and sizes.
- Foreground and background colors, highlighting.
- Hexadecimal character codes.
- Tables (without nested tables).
- Lists.
- Hyperlinks.
- Pictures.

## Compiling notes

The source was compiled with Delphi XE8. It also works in the more recent Delphi 12 Version 29.
Demo application included.
